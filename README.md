# DinoCopterGame v1.0.0.0

![DinoTaxi](Images/logo.png)

A sample game written with MonoGame that targets UWP (xbox, windows 10/11 desktop, and windows 10 mobile) :)  


## My 2 cents
- dinocopter.xap R.E.
- WP7 src code research (very quick, no deep learning yet!)
- I started to adapt the src code for W10M... 

## Status
Draft (still exploring src Content compilation process... fonts generation, texturec, etc.)


## Requirements
* MonoGame v3.7 (or higher)
* [Visual Studio 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (or higher)


## . 
As is. No support.RnD only
